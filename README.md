# forgego
ForgeGo is the Doing OS — a system that replaces project management with movement. Work is forged through three states:  The Fire — where work heats up  The Hammer — where work is shaped  The Anvil — where work is finished  Designed for speed, clarity, and zero‑bullshit execution. Built with Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, and Vercel.
